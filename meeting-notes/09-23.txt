--new project description--

Customers will use a Tango tablet, which is an augmented reality and spatial 
recognition device, to walk around the shed. Tango will display a virtual map 
of the shed as customers walk. Locations along the shed will be associated with
specific seedlings, so when customers hold up the Tango to a plant, the tablet
will show a 3D model of the grown plant, along with care instructions and 
general information.

Technical details: We are making a webpage using Javascript with three.js and
Pyry's Tangova library to build the application. 

Tasks: 
-display the map 
-move around the map 
-put plants on the map (capture plant locations with debug display)
-display plant info (use projectors in three.js to implement)
-build plantdex
-make debug display showing tablet pose
